# School Course Transcript Organizer 

This is a project I decided to do outside of the classroom after my second
term of Computer Science in order to practice using linked lists. I also had 
a genuine need for a program that would allow me to manipulate college course 
information. The program reads data from a text file or creates a new text file 
if none can be found in the home directory. The user is able to add or delete 
courses from the text file. I also added an ability to calculate the GPA of all 
courses on the list.

# How to use

Upon execution the program will ask the user for the name of a text file to open 
and manipulate. I have provided an ideal text file (courses.txt) or the program will
create a new file if you prefer. After loading the file or creating a new one, an 
option menu will appear.
