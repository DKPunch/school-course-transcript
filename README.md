# School Course Transcript Organizer 

This is a project I decided to do outside of the classroom after my first year
of studying Computer Science. I felt it was a good opportunity to implement
a simple data structure (linked list) as well as experiment with some sorting
and inserting ideas. I also had a genuine need for a program that would 
allow me to manipulate college course information. The program reads data from 
a text file or creates a new text file if none can be found in the home directory. 
The user is able to add or delete courses from the text file. I also added an 
ability to calculate the GPA of all courses on the list, which comes in handy 
for quick calculations when trying to find out an overall GPA for students who
have attended multiple schools.

# How to use

Upon execution the program will ask the user for the name of a text file to open 
and manipulate. I have provided an ideal text file (courses.txt) or the program will
create a new file if you prefer. After loading the file or creating a new one, an 
option menu will appear.
